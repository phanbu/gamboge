# Pock√©tMonsters: Gamboge

## At the beginning
We wake up to a bright shiny day.  Yawn.  We exit our little bush house.  We meet our friend, Sally.  

```
Sally:  Hey, <PlayerName>, I heard that Simon said that you 
        don't know anything about training PocketMonsters.  
        I think that you can beat him!  What happened to all
        of your PocketMonsters?
```

If you try to leave town, you run into Bob.

```
Bob:    Hey! You can't leave the village.  If you want to 
        challenge Simon to a battle, you need to have a 
        PocketMonster with you.
```

## In the Village
You go into the long grass. Eventually, you hear a rustling. You have to catch a PocketMonster.

You need to have a PocketBall, so you need to go to the shop to buy one.
To buy one, you need a coin.
You can get a coin by talking to Bert in his tent.

```
Bert:   Are you going to challenge Simon?!?  Take this coin 
        so that you can start your adventure. 
```

After you get the PocketBall, Bob will let you leave the village.

```
Bob:   Good luck, <PlayerName>
```

## In the Forest
You can challenge several people to a PocketMonster battle. 

When you win:  Your PocketMonster gains XP.
When you lose:  Your PocketMonster faints.

Go to the PocketCenter to heal your PocketMonsters.


## In town
There is a gym in town where you can battle with Kelly.
If you beat Kelly, she will give you a badge and ????

Somehow, this will let us access to the cave. 
**Need a story point for this**

## On the beach
This will let us take a boat to MetroCity, where Simon runs the gym.
We win the game when we defeat Simon.
